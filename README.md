# My second JS project

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/calculator)


* This is a web-based calculator
* Here are a few of my reflections immediately upon finishing
    * Logic turned out to be more challenging than I expected
    * This was my first attempt to re-factor code, I really like how it helped clarify my thinking and understanding
    * Definitely got tripped up a few times on the flow of my code
    * A lesson I continue to learn: Think about the logic all the way through before you start writing!

* This was a lot of fun, and if anyone ever comes across this code and has feedback, please share it with me!
